				<p><a href="/blog/power-supply-for-bare-esp8266">For battery powered ESP 8266 projects we would like to have a full control over electrical components that we use on board. This is because everything that draws power will also drain our battery, and this is something we want to avoid. The Wemos D1 Mini module seems to have the lowest memory consumption of them all, but we can still be better. In my battery powered projects I use ESP-12F modules and custom power...</a></p>

				<p><a href="/blog/gradle-retro-plugin">The idea of a tool that can automatically download all dependencies and build my 6502 projects arose some time ago. In the meantime I started using 64spec for testing my assembly code. The library itself is great but requires a lot of manual operations once a great number of test files are created. I have noticed that Michał Taszycki, an author of 64spec, has already written a proof of concept tool, so that 64spec can...</a></p>

				<p><a href="/blog/esp8266-weather-station-1">The ESP 8266 has relatively high power consumption (around 70-80mA) which makes battery powered devices difficult to build, unless we accept a very short battery lifetime. Reasons for this are apparently connected with WiFi communication model, which is not especially economical, big processing power of the ESP chip itself has also an influence on this. But I really like 8266 because setting up the network topology is trivial - there is nothing to be set...</a></p>

				<p><a href="/blog/esp8266">For some time I had an idea to do few “home improvements” and, as a side effect, learn a bit about microcontrollers and electronics. So called “smart home” can be expensive - there are a lot of out-of-the-box solutions that cost a small fortune (as I said: “for some time”, now it is cheaper). So my idea really was: can I do it as cheap as possible? After some research I decided to build my...</a></p>

				<p><a href="/blog/docu-for-c64lib">I have finally managed to set up documentation web site for c64lib. It is available under
following link: https://c64lib.github.io/docu/

There is a dedicated news section where most of the content of this blog is being migrated
(not too much content). I plan to expand this page with manual and howto pages related to
installation and usage. Stay tuned.

				<p><a href="/blog/macro-hosted-subroutines">Subroutine is an essential concept in programming. Advantages of using subroutines are quite clear - instead of doing a repetitive work, we define chunk of code once and “jump” to it any time we need it. It is a part of DRY principle (do not repeat yourself), which allows to keep our code compact and maintainable. It allows us to keep memory footprint of our code at reasonable level. With possibility of passing execution arguments...</a></p>

				<p><a href="/blog/new-psu-for-c64">Reliability of original C64 CPU has been disputed in community for long time. Commodore had problems with it in the past, plenty of houses were put on fire. Today, over 35 years after first Commodore 64 was produced another issue becomes especially painful: some of bricks decide now to ignore its spec and generate voltage that exceeds its nominal 5VDC thus frying most of precious chips. Original PSU is not easy to replace. Commodore decided...</a></p>
