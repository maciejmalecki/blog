For some time I had an idea to do few "home improvements" and, as a side effect, learn a bit about microcontrollers and electronics. So called "smart home" can be expensive - there are a lot of out-of-the-box solutions that cost a small fortune (as I said: "for some time", now it is cheaper). So my idea really was: can I do it as cheap as possible?

After some research I decided to build my solution around some central software working on Raspberry Pi 3 and some amount of sensing- and command-nodes built with some cheap MCUs and radio transmitters, maybe even battery powered. My initial choice was to use AVR microcontrolers (yes, the ones from Arduino) and cheap NRF24L01 transceivers.

I wanted to build something looking like star (see diagram):
