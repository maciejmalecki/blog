I'm glad to revive this blog and inform you that together with Rafa≈Ç Dudek, Adam Gilmore and Sami Juntunen we managed to release a C64 version of the [Tony: Montezuma's Gold](https://monochrome-productions.itch.io/tony).

The game has been written in KickAssembler and is available for purchase both as digital or physical.

![Boxed version]({{ "/cbm/img/tony/box.jpg" | absolute_url }} "Tony box")

I had to upskill in several areas of Commodore 64 knowledge including crunching, disk access and cartridge management, surely I will blog about that!
Stay tuned...
