   <updated>2018-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Subroutine is an essential concept in programming. Advantages of using subroutines are quite clear - instead of doing a repetitive work, we define chunk of code once and “jump” to it any time we need it.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reliability of original C64 CPU has been disputed in community for long time. Commodore had problems with it in the past, plenty of houses were put on fire.
